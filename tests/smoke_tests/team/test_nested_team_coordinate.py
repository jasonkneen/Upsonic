Smoke test for nested Team as entity in coordinate mode.

Verifies:
- Result is non-empty string
- Leader agent is created by framework
- Leader has memory, member entities do not receive it
- Debug prints show coordinate delegation with entity type and name
- delegate_task tool call appears in output
